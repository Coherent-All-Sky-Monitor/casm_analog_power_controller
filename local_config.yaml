# Local Configuration for Raspberry Pi Hardware Controller
# This file tells THIS Pi what hardware it controls
#
# Customize these values to match your hardware setup

# Unique identifier for this Pi (must match an entry in main server's config.yaml)
pi_id: "pi_1"

# Which chassis numbers this Pi controls (list of integers 1-4)
# Examples:
#   [1, 2, 3, 4]  - Controls all chassis (typical for single Pi setup)
#   [1]           - Controls only chassis 1
#   [1, 2]        - Controls chassis 1 and 2
#   [3, 4]        - Controls chassis 3 and 4
chassis_controlled: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Number of relay boards physically connected to THIS Pi
# Each board has 8 relays
# Match this to your actual hardware!
num_relay_boards: 6

# Relays per board (default is 8 for Sequent Microsystems 8-relay boards)
relays_per_board: 8

# Configuration Notes:
# - Stack numbers are always LOCAL (starting from 0) on each Pi
# - num_relay_boards should match the physical boards connected
# - chassis_controlled must match what's in main server's config.yaml for this pi_id
# - System adapts automatically to any configuration
