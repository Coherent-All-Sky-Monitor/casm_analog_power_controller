# Main Server Configuration
# This file tells the main server where all Raspberry Pis are located
# and which chassis each Pi controls
#
# Add/remove/modify Pis as needed - the system adapts automatically

raspberry_pis:
  pi_1:
    ip_address: "192.168.1.100"  # Change to your Pi's actual IP
    port: 5001
    chassis: [1, 2, 3, 4]        # Which chassis this Pi controls (1-4)
    description: "Main Pi"        # Optional description
  
  # Add more Pis as needed:
  # pi_2:
  #   ip_address: "192.168.1.101"
  #   port: 5001
  #   chassis: [2]
  #   description: "Chassis 2 Pi"

# Status Check Settings
status_check_interval: 30  # Check Pi status every N seconds
request_timeout: 5          # Timeout for requests to Pis (seconds)

# Configuration Notes:
# - Each Pi can control any combination of chassis [1-4]
# - Each chassis can only be assigned to ONE Pi
# - chassis list in config.yaml must match each Pi's local_config.yaml
# - Add/remove Pi entries as needed - no code changes required
# - Use static IPs for production deployments
